I can get the key summary statistics, etc., to you later but the idea would be to annotate the pchic loops with the strength (blue = CD4 strength 35 for a variant with PP 0.765 for WBC; red = Ery strength 28 for a variant with all 5 red traits PP > 0.998; purple B cell strength = 12 for a lymph count variant with PP 0.9359)


[3:00] 
for the IL11RA, the loop indicates a whole blood eQTL p < 3.93*10^-8 in whole blood gtex


[3:01] 
additionally, Erik has motifs that we can annotate on at least some of the IKZF1 plots; perhaps the red and purple?


[3:01] 
oh right, and then for the GTEX variant, WBC PP 0.86 and Lymph is 0.966
